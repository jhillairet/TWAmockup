| Time | Pin/duration | fMHz | Comment | 
| :--: | :----------: | :--: | :-----: |
| 13-06-15 | 1.00 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-10-21 | 1.20 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-11-53 | 1.40 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-12-55 | 1.60 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> SHAD triggers | 
| 13-15-00 | 1.50 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-15-35 | 1.60 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-16-27 | 1.70 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> OK | 
| 13-17-21 | 1.75 MW / 3s | 55.5 | 2s ramp-up -> SHAD triggers | 
| 13-18-08 | 1.75 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat -> SHAD triggers |
| 13-19-18 | 1.75 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat changing SHAD channel -> SHAD triggers all the time (?) |
| 13-21-09 | 1.75 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat -> SHAD triggers |
| 13-21-58 | 1.75 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat without SHAD -> OK |
| 13-24-17 | 1.80 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat without SHAD ->  generator limitations (1.2 MW dissipated power limit reached) |
| 13-25-54 | 1.80 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat without SHAD ->  generator limitations (1.2 MW dissipated power limit reached) |
| 13-30-50 | 1.80 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat without SHAD and reduction factor 0.8 to 0.6 and 1.3 MW dissipated power -> 2 generator limit |
| 13-34-47 | 1.90 MW / 2s | 55.5 | repeat with shorter plateau length -> still some generator limits reached |
| 13-36-52 | 1.90 MW / 2s | 55.5 | repeat with 1.4 MW on dissipated power -> OK ! |
| 13-39-24 | 1.90 MW / 3s | 55.5 | repeat a bit longer -> OK ! |
